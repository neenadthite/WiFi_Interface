NAME
     hostapd --	authenticator for IEEE 802.11 networks

SYNOPSIS
     hostapd [-BdhKtv] [-P pidfile] config-file	...

DESCRIPTION
     The hostapd utility is an authenticator for IEEE 802.11 networks.	It
     provides full support for WPA/IEEE	802.11i	and can	also act as an IEEE
     802.1X Authenticator with a suitable backend Authentication Server	(typi-
     cally FreeRADIUS).	 The hostapd utility implements	the authentication
     protocols that piggyback on top of	the normal IEEE	802.11 protocol	mecha-
     nisms.  To	use hostapd as an authenticator, the underlying	device must
     support some basic	functionality such as the ability to set security in-
     formation in the 802.11 management	frames.	 Beware	that not all devices
     have this support.

     The hostapd utility is designed to	be a "daemon" program that runs	in the
     background	and acts as the	backend	component controlling the wireless
     connection.  It supports separate frontend	programs such as the text-
     based frontend, hostapd_cli(8).

     The following arguments must be specified on the command line:

     config-file
	     Use the settings in the specified configuration file; the name of
	     the specified wireless interface is contained in this file.  See
	     hostapd.conf(5) for a description of the configuration file syn-
	     tax.

	     Changes to	the configuration file can be reloaded by sending a
	     SIGHUP to the hostapd processor or	with the hostapd_cli(8)	util-
	     ity, using	"hostapd_cli reconfigure".

OPTIONS
     The options are as	follows:

     -d	     Enable debugging messages.	 If this option	is supplied twice,
	     more verbose messages are displayed.

     -h	     Show help text.

     -t	     Include timestamps	in debugging output.

     -v	     Display version information on the	terminal and exit.

     -B	     Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a daemon process
	     in	the background.

     -K	     Include key information in	debugging output.

     -P	pidfile
	     Store PID in pidfile.

Tested example:
hostapd -B /etc/hostapd.conf -dddt > log_file
